<h1>Chapter 1 -  Clean Code</h1>
</a>
This Book is about good programming. It's about how to write good code, and how to transform bad code into good code.

The code represents the detail of the requirements and the details cannot be ignored or abstracted. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We can create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision.

### Why write bad code?

- Are you in a rush?
- Do you try to go "fast"?
- Do not you have time to do a good job?
- Are you tired of work in the same program/module?
- Does your Boss push you to finish soon?

The previous arguments could create a swamp of senseless code.

If you say "I will back to fix it later" you could fall in the [LeBlanc's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AList_of_eponymous_laws#Proposal_to_add_LeBlanc.27s_law) "Later equals never"

You are a professional and the code is your responsibility. Let's analyze the following anecdote:

> What if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time? Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to comply with the patient.

So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.

Maybe sometime you think in go fast to make the deadline. The only way to go fast is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

### What is Clean Code?

Each experimented programmer has his/her own definition of clean code, but something is clear, a clean code is a code that you can read easily. The clean code is code that has been taken care of.

In his book Uncle Bob says the next:

> Consider this book a description of the Object Mentor School of Clean Code. The techniques and teachings within are the way that we practice our art. We are willing to claim that if you follow these teachings, you will enjoy the benefits that we have enjoyed, and you will learn to write code that is clean and professional. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that we are somehow “right” in any absolute sense. There are other schools and other masters that have just as much claim to professionalism as we. It would behoove you to learn from them as well.

### The boy Scout Rule

It’s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We have all seen code rot and degrade as time passes. So we must take an active role in preventing this degradation.

It's a good practice apply the [Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule)

> Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

<a name="chapter2">
<h1>Chapter 2 -  Meaningful Names</h1>
</a>

Names are everywhere in software. Files, directories, variables functions, etc. Because we do so much of it. We have better do it well.

### Use Intention-Revealing Names

It is easy to say that names reveal intent. Choosing good names takes time, but saves more than it takes. So take care with your names and change them when you find better ones.

The name of a variable, function or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how is used. **If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveals its intent**.

| Does not reveals intention       | Reveals intention       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `int d; // elapsed time in days` | `int elapsedTimeInDays` |

Choosing names that reveal intent can make much easier to understand and change code. Example:

```java
public List<int[]> getThem() {
  List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
  for (int[] x : theList)
    if (x[0] == 4)
      list1.add(x);
  return list1;
}
```

This code is simple, but create many questions:

1. What is the content of `theList`?
2. What is the significance of the item `x[0]` in the list?.
3. Why we compare `x[0]` vs `4`?
4. How would i use the returned list?

The answers to these questions are not present in the code sample, but they could have been. Say that we’re working in a mine sweeper game. We can refactor the previous code as follows:

```java
public List<int[]> getFlaggedCells() {
  List<int[]> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<int[]>();
  for (int[] cell : gameBoard)
    if (cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED)
      flaggedCells.add(cell);
  return flaggedCells;
}
```

Now we know the next information:

1. `theList` represents the `gameBoard`
2. `x[0]` represents a cell in the board and `4` represents a flagged cell
3. The returned list represents the `flaggedCells`

Notice that the simplicity of the code has not changed. It still has exactly the same number of operators and constants, with exactly the same number of nesting levels. But the code has become much more explicit.

We can improve the code writing a simple class for cells instead of using an array of `ints`. It can include an **intention-revealing function** (called it `isFlagged`) to hide the magic numbers. It results in a new function of the function.

```java
public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
  List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
  for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
    if (cell.isFlagged())
      flaggedCells.add(cell);
  return flaggedCells;
}
```

### Avoid Disinformation

Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We should avoid words whose entrenched meaning vary from our intended meaning.

Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`. The word `List` means something specific to programmers. If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to false conclusions. So `accountGroup` or `bunchOfAccounts` or just plain `accounts` would be better.

Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does it take to spot the subtle difference between a `XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings` in one module and, somewhere a little more distant, `XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings`? The words have frightfully similar shapes

### Make Meaningful Distinctions

Programmers create problems for themselves when they write code solely to satisfy a compiler or interpreter. For example because you can't use the same name to refer two different things in the same scope, you might be tempted to change one name in an arbitrary way. Sometimes this is done by misspelling one, leading to the surprising situation where correcting spelling errors leads to an inability to compile. Example, you create the variable `klass`because the name `class` was used for something else.

In the next function, the arguments are noninformative, `a1` and `a2` doesn't provide clues to the author intention.

```java
public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
  for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
    a2[i] = a1[i];
  }
}
```

We can improve the code selecting more explicit argument names:

```java
public static void copyChars(char source[], char destination[]) {
  for (int i = 0; i < source.length; i++) {
    destination[i] = source[i];
  }
}
```

Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a Product class. If you have another called `ProductInfo` or `ProductData`, you have made the names different without making them mean anything different. Info and Data are indistinct noise words like a, an, and the.

Noise words are redundant. The word variable should never appear in a variable name. The word table should never appear in a table name.

### Use Pronounceable Names

Imagine you have the variable `genymdhms` (Generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute and second) and imagine a conversation where you need talk about this variable calling it "gen why emm dee aich emm ess". You can consider convert a class like this:

```java
class DtaRcrd102 {
  private Date genymdhms;
  private Date modymdhms;
  private final String pszqint = "102";
  /* ... */
};
```

To

```java
class Customer {
  private Date generationTimestamp;
  private Date modificationTimestamp;;
  private final String recordId = "102";
  /* ... */
};
```

### Use Searchable Names

Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.

### Avoid Encoding

We have enough encodings to deal with without adding more to our burden. Encoding type or scope information into names simply adds an extra burden of deciphering. Encoded names are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type. An example of this, is the use of the [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) or the use of member prefixes.

#### Interfaces and Implementations

These are sometimes a special case for encodings. For example, say you are building an ABSTRACT FACTORY for the creation of shapes. This factory will be an interface and will be implemented by a concrete class. What should you name them? `IShapeFactory` and `ShapeFactory`? Is preferable to leave interfaces unadorned.I don’t want my users knowing that I’m handing them an interface. I just want them to know that it’s a `ShapeFactory`. So if I must encode either the interface or the implementation, I choose the implementation. Calling it `ShapeFactoryImp`, or even the hideous `CShapeFactory`, is preferable to encoding the interface.

### Avoid Mental Mapping

Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into other names they already know.

One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

### Class Names

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like `Customer`, `WikiPage`, `Account`, and `AddressParser`. Avoid words like `Manager`,`Processor`, `Data`, or `Info` in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

### Method Names

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment`, `deletePage` or `save`. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get, set, and is according to the javabean standard.

When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments. For example:

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
```

Is generally better than

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);
```

Consider enforcing their use by making the corresponding constructors private.

### Don't Be Cute

| Cute name         | Clean name    |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| `holyHandGranade` | `deleteItems` |
| `whack`           | `kill`        |
| `eatMyShorts`     | `abort`       |

### Pick one word per concept

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes.

### Don’t Pun

Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.

Example: in a class use `add` for create a new value by adding or concatenating two existing values and in another class use `add` for put a simple parameter in a collection, it's a better options use a name like `insert` or `append` instead.

### Use Solution Domain Names

Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go ahead and use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.

### Use Problem Domain Names

When there is no “programmer-eese” for what you’re doing, use the name from the problem domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert what it means.

### Add Meaningful context

There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves—most are not. Instead, you need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort

Variables like: `firstName`, `lastName`, `street`, `city`, `state`. Taken together it's pretty clear that they form an address, but, what if you saw the variable state being used alone in a method?, you could add context using prefixes like: `addrState` at least readers will understand that the variable is part of a large structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named `Address` then even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept

### Don’t Add Gratuitous Context

In an imaginary application called “Gas Station Deluxe,” it is a bad idea to prefix every class with GSD. Example: `GSDAccountAddress`

Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.

<a name="chapter3">
<h1>Chapter 3 -  Functions</h1>
</a>

Functions are the first line of organization in any topic.

### Small!!

The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.

#### Blocks and Indenting

This implies that the blocks within `if` statements, `else` statements, `while` statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line should be a function call. Not only does this keep the enclosing function small, but also adds documentary value because the function called within the block can have a nicely descriptive name.

This also implies that functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures. Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two. This, of course, makes the functions easy to read and understand.

### Do One Thing

**FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.**

#### Sections within Functions

If you have a function divided in sections like _declarations_, _initialization_ etc, it's a obvious symptom of the function is doing more than one thing. Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections.

### One Level of Abstraction per Function

In order to make sure our functions are doing "one thing", we need to make sure that the statements within our function are all at the same level of abstraction.

#### Reading Code from Top to Bottom: _The Stepdown Rule_

We want the code to read like a top-down narrative. 5 We want every function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions.

To say this differently, we want to be able to read the program as though it were a set
of TO paragraphs, each of which is describing the current level of abstraction and referencing subsequent TO paragraphs at the next level down.

```
- To include the setups and teardowns, we include setups, then we include the test page content, and then we include the teardowns.
- To include the setups, we include the suite setup if this is a suite, then we include the regular setup.
- To include the suite setup, we search the parent hierarchy for the “SuiteSetUp” page and add an include statement with the path of that page.
- To search the parent...
```

It turns out to be very difficult for programmers to learn to follow this rule and write functions that stay at a single level of abstraction. But learning this trick is also very important. It is the key to keeping functions short and making sure they do “one thing.” Making the code read like a top-down set of TO paragraphs is an effective technique for keeping the abstraction level consistent.

### Switch Statements

It’s hard to make a small switch statement. 6 Even a switch statement with only two cases is larger than I’d like a single block or function to be. It’s also hard to make a switch statement that does one thing. By their nature, switch statements always do N things. Unfortunately we can’t always avoid switch statements, but we can make sure that each switch statement is buried in a low-level class and is never repeated. We do this, of course, with polymorphism.

### Use Descriptive Names

> You know you are working on clean code when each routine turns out to be pretty much what you expected

Half the battle to achieving that principle is choosing good names for small functions that do one thing. The smaller and more focused a function is, the easier it is to choose a descriptive name.

Don’t be afraid to make a name long. A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment. Use a naming convention that allows multiple words to be easily read in the function names, and then make use of those multiple words to give the function a name that says what it does.

Choosing descriptive names will clarify the design of the module in your mind and help you to improve it. It is not at all uncommon that hunting for a good name results in a favorable restructuring of the code.

### Function arguments

The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.

Arguments are even harder from a testing point of view. Imagine the difficulty of writing all the test cases to ensure that all the various combinations of arguments work properly. If there are no arguments, this is trivial. If there’s one argument, it’s not too hard. With two arguments the problem gets a bit more challenging. With more than two arguments, testing every combination of appropriate values can be daunting.

Output arguments are harder to understand than input arguments. When we read a function, we are used to the idea of information going in to the function through arguments and out through the return value. We don’t usually expect information to be going out through the arguments. So output arguments often cause us to do a double-take.

#### Common Monadic Forms

There are two very common reasons to pass a single argument into a function. You may be asking a question about that argument, as in `boolean fileExists(“MyFile”)` . Or you may be operating on that argument, transforming it into something else and returning it. For example, `InputStream fileOpen(“MyFile”)` transforms a file name `String` into an `InputStream` return value. These two uses are what readers expect when they see a function. You should choose names that make the distinction clear, and always use the two forms in a consistent context.

#### Flag Arguments

Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice. It immediately complicates the signature of the method, loudly proclaiming that this function does more than one thing. It does one thing if the flag is `true` and another if the flag is `false`!

#### Dyadic Functions

A function with two arguments is harder to understand than a monadic function. For example, `writeField(name)` is easier to understand than `writeField(output-Stream, name)`

There are times, of course, where two arguments are appropriate. For example, `Point p = new Point(0,0);` is perfectly reasonable. Cartesian points naturally take two arguments.

Even obvious dyadic functions like assertEquals(expected, actual) are problematic. How many times have you put the actual where the expected should be? The two arguments have no natural ordering. The expected, actual ordering is a convention that requires practice to learn.

Dyads aren’t evil, and you will certainly have to write them. However, you should be aware that they come at a cost and should take advantage of what mechanims may be available to you to convert them into monads. For example, you might make the writeField method a member of outputStream so that you can say outputStream. writeField(name) . Or you might make the outputStream a member variable of the current class so that you don’t have to pass it. Or you might extract a new class like FieldWriter that takes the outputStream in its constructor and has a write method.

#### Triads

Functions that take three arguments are significantly harder to understand than dyads. The issues of ordering, pausing, and ignoring are more than doubled. I suggest you think very carefully before creating a triad.

#### Argument Objects

Compare:

```java
Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);
```

vs

```java
Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);
```

#### Verbs and Keywords

Choosing good names for a function can go a long way toward explaining the intent of the function and the order and intent of the arguments. In the case of a monad, the function and argument should form a very nice verb/noun pair. For example, `write(name)` is very evocative. Whatever this “name” thing is, it is being “written.” An even better name might be `writeField(name)` , which tells us that the "name" thing is a "field".

This last is an example of the keyword form of a function name. Using this form we encode the names of the arguments into the function name. For example, `assertEquals` might be better written as `assertExpectedEqualsActual(expected, actual)`. This strongly mitigates the problem of having to remember the ordering of the arguments.

### Output Arguments

In general output arguments should be avoided. If your function must change the state of something, have it change the state of its owning object.

### Command Query Separation

Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion.

### Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes

Returning error codes from command functions is a subtle violation of command query separation.

### Don't Repeat Yourself

Duplication may be the root of all evil in software. Many principles and practices have been created for the purpose of controlling or eliminating it.

### Structured Programming

Some programmers follow Edsger Dijkstra’s rules of structured programming. Dijkstra said that every function, and every block within a function, should have one entry and one exit. Following these rules means that there should only be one return statement in a function, no `break` or `continue` statements in a loop, and never, _ever_, any `goto` statements.

While we are sympathetic to the goals and disciplines of structured programming, those rules serve little benefit when functions are very small. It is only in larger functions that such rules provide significant benefit.

So if you keep your functions small, then the occasional multiple `return` , `break` , or `continue` statement does no harm and can sometimes even be more expressive than the single-entry, single-exit rule. On the other hand, `goto` only makes sense in large functions, so it should be avoided

<a name="chapter4">
<h1>Chapter 4 -  Comments</h1>
</a>

Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment. Nothing can clutter up a module more than frivolous dogmatic comments. Nothing can be quite so damaging as an old comment that propagates lies and misinformation.

If our programming languages were expressive enough, or if we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we would not need comments very much—perhaps not at all.

### Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code

Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments. Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you’ve made, spend it cleaning that mess.

### Explain Yourself in Code

```java
// Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && (employee.age > 65))
```

vs

```java
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())
```

### Good Comments

Some comments are necessary or beneficial. However the only truly good comment is the comment you found a way not to write.

#### Legal Comments

Sometimes our corporate coding standards force us to write certain comments for legal reasons. For example, copyright and authorship statements are necessary and reasonable things to put into a comment at the start of each source file.

#### Informative Comments

It is sometimes useful to provide basic information with a comment. For example, consider this comment that explains the return value of an abstract method:

```java
// Returns an instance of the Responder being tested.
protected abstract Responder responderInstance();
```

A comment like this can sometimes be useful, but it is better to use the name of the function to convey the information where possible. For example, in this case the comment could be made redundant by renaming the function: `responderBeingTested`.

#### Explanation of Intent

Sometimes a comment goes beyond just useful information about the implementation and provides the intent behind a decision. Example:

```java
public int compareTo(Object o)
{
  if(o instanceof WikiPagePath)
  {
    WikiPagePath p = (WikiPagePath) o;
    String compressedName = StringUtil.join(names, "");
    String compressedArgumentName = StringUtil.join(p.names, "");
    return compressedName.compareTo(compressedArgumentName);
  }
  return 1; // we are greater because we are the right type.
}
```

#### Clarification

Sometimes it is just helpful to translate the meaning of some obscure argument or return value into something that's readable. In general it is better to find a way to make that argument or return value clear in its own right; but when its part of the standard library, or in code that you cannot alter, then a helpful clarifying comment can be useful.

#### Warning of concequences

Sometimes it is useful to warn other programmers about certain consequences.

```java
// Don't run unless you
// have some time to kill.
public void _testWithReallyBigFile() {
  writeLinesToFile(10000000);
  response.setBody(testFile);
  response.readyToSend(this);
  String responseString = output.toString();
  assertSubString("Content-Length: 1000000000", responseString);
  assertTrue(bytesSent > 1000000000);
}
```

#### TODO Comments

It is sometimes reasonable to leave “To do” notes in the form of //TODO comments. In the
following case, the TODO comment explains why the function has a degenerate implementation and what that function's future should be.

```java
//TODO-MdM these are not needed
// We expect this to go away when we do the checkout model
protected VersionInfo makeVersion() throws Exception {
  return null;
}
```

TODOs are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some reason can’t do at the moment. It might be a reminder to delete a deprecated feature or a plea for someone else to look at a problem. It might be a request for someone else to think of a better name or a reminder to make a change that is dependent on a planned event. Whatever else a TODO might be, it is not an excuse to leave bad code in the system.

#### Amplification

A comment may be used to amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential.

```java
String listItemContent = match.group(3).trim();
// the trim is real important. It removes the starting
// spaces that could cause the item to be recognized
// as another list.
new ListItemWidget(this, listItemContent, this.level + 1);
return buildList(text.substring(match.end()));
```

#### Javadocs in Public APIs

There is nothing quite so helpful and satisfying as a well-described public API. The javadocs for the standard Java library are a case in point. It would be difficult, at best, to write Java programs without them.

### Bad Comments

Most comments fall into this category. Usually they are crutches or excuses for poor code or justifications for insufficient decisions, amounting to little more than the programmer talking to himself.

#### Mumbling

Plopping in a comment just because you feel you should or because the process requires it, is a hack. If you decide to write a comment, then spend the time necessary to make sure it is the best comment you can write. Example:

```java
public void loadProperties() {

  try {
    String propertiesPath = propertiesLocation + "/" + PROPERTIES_FILE;
    FileInputStream propertiesStream = new FileInputStream(propertiesPath);
    loadedProperties.load(propertiesStream);
  }
  catch(IOException e) {
    // No properties files means all defaults are loaded
  }
}
```

What does that comment in the catch block mean? Clearly meant something to the author, but the meaning not come though all that well. Apparently, if we get an `IOException`, it means that there was no properties file; and in that case all the defaults are loaded. But who loads all the defaults?

#### Redundant Comments

```java
// Utility method that returns when this.closed is true. Throws an exception
// if the timeout is reached.
public synchronized void waitForClose(final long timeoutMillis) throws Exception {
  if(!closed) {
    wait(timeoutMillis);
    if(!closed)
      throw new Exception("MockResponseSender could not be closed");
  }
}
```

What purpose does this comment serve? It’s certainly not more informative than the code. It does not justify the code, or provide intent or rationale. It is not easier to read than the code. Indeed, it is less precise than the code and entices the reader to accept that lack of precision in lieu of true understanding.

#### Misleading comments

Sometimes, with all the best intentions, a programmer makes a statement in his comments that isn't precise enough to be accurate. Consider for another moment the example of the previous section. The method does not return when `this.closed` becomes `true`. It returns if `this.closed` is `true`; otherwise, it waits for a blind time-out and then throws an exception if `this.closed` is still not true.

#### Mandated Comments

It is just plain silly to have a rule that says that every function must have a javadoc, or every variable must have a comment. Comments like this just clutter up the code, propagate lies, and lend to general confusion and disorganization.

```java
/**
*
* @param title The title of the CD
* @param author The author of the CD
* @param tracks The number of tracks on the CD
* @param durationInMinutes The duration of the CD in minutes
*/
public void addCD(String title, String author, int tracks, int durationInMinutes) {
  CD cd = new CD();
  cd.title = title;
  cd.author = author;
  cd.tracks = tracks;
  cd.duration = duration;
  cdList.add(cd);
}
```

#### Journal Comments

Sometimes people add a comment to the start of a module every time they edit it. Example:

```java
* Changes (from 11-Oct-2001)
* --------------------------
* 11-Oct-2001 : Re-organised the class and moved it to new package com.jrefinery.date (DG);
* 05-Nov-2001 : Added a getDescription() method, and eliminated NotableDate class (DG);
* 12-Nov-2001 : IBD requires setDescription() method, now that NotableDate class is gone (DG); Changed getPreviousDayOfWeek(),
getFollowingDayOfWeek() and getNearestDayOfWeek() to correct bugs (DG);
* 05-Dec-2001 : Fixed bug in SpreadsheetDate class (DG);
```

Today we have source code control systems, we don't need this type of logs.

#### Noise Comments

The comments in the follow examples doesn't provides new information.

```java
/**
* Default constructor.
*/
protected AnnualDateRule() {
}
```

```java
/** The day of the month. */
private int dayOfMonth;
```

Javadocs comments could enter in this category. Many times they are just redundant noisy comments written out of some misplaced desire to provide documentation.

#### Don’t Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable

Example:

```java
// does the module from the global list <mod> depend on the
// subsystem we are part of?
if (smodule.getDependSubsystems().contains(subSysMod.getSubSystem()))
```

vs

```java
ArrayList moduleDependees = smodule.getDependSubsystems();
String ourSubSystem = subSysMod.getSubSystem();
if (moduleDependees.contains(ourSubSystem))
```

#### Position Markers

This type of comments are noising

```java
// Actions //////////////////////////////////
```

#### Closing Brace Comments

Example:

```java
public class wc {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String line;
    int lineCount = 0;
    int charCount = 0;
    int wordCount = 0;
    try {
      while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
        lineCount++;
        charCount += line.length();
        String words[] = line.split("\\W");
        wordCount += words.length;

      } //while
      System.out.println("wordCount = " + wordCount);
      System.out.println("lineCount = " + lineCount);
      System.out.println("charCount = " + charCount);

    } // try
    catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("Error:" + e.getMessage());

    } //catch

  } //main
```

You could break the code in small functions instead to use this type of comments.

#### Attributions and Bylines

Example:

`/* Added by Rick */`

The VCS can manage this information instead.

#### Commented-Out Code

```java
InputStreamResponse response = new InputStreamResponse();
response.setBody(formatter.getResultStream(), formatter.getByteCount());
// InputStream resultsStream = formatter.getResultStream();
// StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(resultsStream);
// response.setContent(reader.read(formatter.getByteCount()));
```

If you don't need anymore, please delete it, you can back later with your VCS if you need it again.

#### HTML Comments

HTML in source code comments is an abomination, as you can tell by reading the code below.

```java
/**
* Task to run fit tests.
* This task runs fitnesse tests and publishes the results.
* <p/>
* <pre>
* Usage:
* &lt;taskdef name=&quot;execute-fitnesse-tests&quot;
* classname=&quot;fitnesse.ant.ExecuteFitnesseTestsTask&quot;
* classpathref=&quot;classpath&quot; /&gt;
* OR
* &lt;taskdef classpathref=&quot;classpath&quot;
* resource=&quot;tasks.properties&quot; /&gt;
* <p/>
* &lt;execute-fitnesse-tests
* suitepage=&quot;FitNesse.SuiteAcceptanceTests&quot;
* fitnesseport=&quot;8082&quot;
* resultsdir=&quot;${results.dir}&quot;
* resultshtmlpage=&quot;fit-results.html&quot;
* classpathref=&quot;classpath&quot; /&gt;
* </pre>
*/
```

#### Nonlocal Information

If you must write a comment, then make sure it describes the code it appears near. Don't offer systemwide information in the context of a local comment.

#### Too Much Information

Don't put interesting historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of details into your comments.

#### Inobvious Connection

The connection between a comment and the code it describes should be obvious. If you are going to the trouble to write a comment, then at least you'd like the reader to be able to look at the comment and the code and understand what the comment is talking about

#### Function Headers

Short functions don’t need much description. A well-chosen name for a small function that does one thing is usually better than a comment header.

#### Javadocs in Nonpublic Code

Javadocs are for public APIs, in nonpublic code could be a distraction more than a help.

<h1>Chapter 5 -  Formatting</h1>
</a>

Code formatting is important. It is too important to ignore and it is too important to treat religiously. Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer’s first order of business.

### Vertical Formatting

#### Vertical Openness Between Concepts

This concept consist in how to you separate concepts in your code, In the next example we can appreciate it.

```java
package fitnesse.wikitext.widgets;

import java.util.regex.*;

public class BoldWidget extends ParentWidget {
  public static final String REGEXP = "'''.+?'''";
  private static final Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("'''(.+?)'''",
      Pattern.MULTILINE + Pattern.DOTALL
      );

  public BoldWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) throws Exception {
    super(parent);
    Matcher match = pattern.matcher(text);
    match.find();
    addChildWidgets(match.group(1));
  }

  public String render() throws Exception {
    StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<b>");
    html.append(childHtml()).append("</b>");
    return html.toString();
  }
}
```

```java
package fitnesse.wikitext.widgets;
import java.util.regex.*;
public class BoldWidget extends ParentWidget {
  public static final String REGEXP = "'''.+?'''";
  private static final Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("'''(.+?)'''",
  Pattern.MULTILINE + Pattern.DOTALL);
  public BoldWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) throws Exception {
    super(parent);
    Matcher match = pattern.matcher(text); match.find(); addChildWidgets(match.group(1));
  }
  public String render() throws Exception { StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<b>"); html.append(childHtml()).append("</b>"); return html.toString();
  }
}
```

As you can see, the readability of the first example is greater than that of the second.

#### Vertical Density

The vertical density implies close association. So lines of code that are tightly related should appear vertically dense. Check the follow example:

```Java
public class ReporterConfig {

	/**
	 * The class name of the reporter listener */
	private String m_className;

	/**
	 * The properties of the reporter listener */
	private List<Property> m_properties = new ArrayList<Property>();

	public void addProperty(Property property) { m_properties.add(property);
	}
```

```java
public class ReporterConfig {
  private String m_className;
  private List<Property> m_properties = new ArrayList<Property>();

  public void addProperty(Property property) {
    m_properties.add(property);
  }
}
```

The second code it's much easier to read. It fits in an "eye-full".

#### Vertical Distance

**Variable Declarations**. Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible. Because our functions are very short, local variables should appear at the top of each function,

**Instance variables**, on the other hand, should be declared at the top of the class. This should not increase the vertical distance of these variables, because in a well-designed class, they are used by many, if not all, of the methods of the class.

There have been many debates over where instance variables should go. In C++ we commonly practiced the so-called scissors rule, which put all the instance variables at the bottom. The common convention in Java, however, is to put them all at the top of the class. I see no reason to follow any other convention. The important thing is for the instance variables to be declared in one well-known place. Everybody should know where to go to see the declarations.

**Dependent Functions**. If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible. This gives the program a natural flow. If the convention is followed reliably, readers will be able to trust that function definitions will follow shortly after their use.

**Conceptual Affinity**. Certain bits of code want to be near other bits. They have a certain conceptual affinity. The stronger that affinity, the less vertical distance there should be between them.

#### Vertical Ordering

In general we want function call dependencies to point in the downward direction. That is, a function that is called should be below a function that does the calling. This creates a nice flow down the source code module from high level to low level. _(This is the exact opposite of languages like Pascal, C, and C++ that enforce functions to be defined, or at least declared, before they are used)_

### Horizontal Formatting

#### Horizontal Openness and Density

We use horizontal white space to associate things that are strongly related and disassociate things that are more weakly related. Example:

```java
private void measureLine(String line) {
  lineCount++;
  int lineSize = line.length();
  totalChars += lineSize;
  lineWidthHistogram.addLine(lineSize, lineCount);
  recordWidestLine(lineSize);
}
```

Assignment statements have two distinct and major elements: the left side and the right side. The spaces make that separation obvious.

#### Horizontal Alignment

```java
public class Example implements Base
{
  private   Socket      socket;
  private   inputStream input;
  protected long        requestProgress;

  public Expediter(Socket      s,
                   inputStream input) {
    this.socket =     s;
    this.input  =     input;
  }
}
```

In modern languages this type of alignment is not useful. The alignment seems to emphasize the wrong things and leads my eye away from the true intent.

```java
public class Example implements Base
{
  private Socket socket;
  private inputStream input;
  protected longrequestProgress;

  public Expediter(Socket s, inputStream input) {

    this.socket = s;
    this.input = input;
  }
}
```

This is a better approach.

### Indentation

The indentation it's important because help us to have a visible hierarchy and well defined blocks.

### Team Rules

Every programmer has his own favorite formatting rules, but if he works in a team, then the team rules.

A team of developers should agree upon a single formatting style, and then every member of that team should use that style. We want the software to have a consistent style. We don't want it to appear to have been written by a bunch of disagreeing individuals.

<a name="chapter6">
<h1>Chapter 6 -  Objects and Data Structures</h1>
</a>

### Data Abstraction

Hiding implementation is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions between the variables. Hiding implementation is about abstractions! A class does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters. Rather it exposes abstract interfaces that allow its users to manipulate the essence of the data, without having to know its implementation.

### Data/Object Anti-Symmetry

These two examples show the difference between objects and data structures. Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions.

**Procedural Shape**

```java
public class Square {
  public Point topLeft;
  public double side;
}

public class Rectangle {
  public Point topLeft;
  public double height;
  public double width;
}

public class Circle {
  public Point center;
  public double radius;
}

public class Geometry {
  public final double PI = 3.141592653589793;

  public double area(Object shape) throws NoSuchShapeException {
    if (shape instanceof Square) {
      Square s = (Square)shape;
      return s.side * s.side;
    }
    else if (shape instanceof Rectangle) { Rectangle r = (Rectangle)shape; return r.height * r.width;
    }
    else if (shape instanceof Circle) {
      Circle c = (Circle)shape;
      return PI * c.radius * c.radius;
    }
    throw new NoSuchShapeException();
  }
}
```

**Polymorphic Shape**

```java
public class Square implements Shape {
  private Point topLeft;
  private double side;

  public double area() {
    return side*side;
  }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
  private Point topLeft;
  private double height;
  private double width;

  public double area() {
    return height * width;
  }
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
  private Point center;
  private double radius;
  public final double PI = 3.141592653589793;

  public double area() {
    return PI * radius * radius;
  }
}
```

Again, we see the complimentary nature of these two definitions; they are virtual opposites! This exposes the fundamental dichotomy between objects and data structures:

> Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions.

The complement is also true:

> Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change.

Mature programmers know that the idea that everything is an object is a myth. Sometimes you really do want simple data structures with procedures operating on them.

### The Law of [Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)

There is a well-known heuristic called the Law of Demeter that says a module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates.

More precisely, the Law of Demeter says that a method `f` of a class `C` should only call the methods of these:

- `C`
- An object created by `f`
- An object passed as an argument to `f`
- An object held in an instance variable of `C`

The method should not invoke methods on objects that are returned by any of the allowed functions. In other words, talk to friends, not to strangers.

### Data Transfer Objects

The quintessential form of a data structure is a class with public variables and no functions. This is sometimes called a data transfer object, or DTO. DTOs are very useful structures, especially when communicating with databases or parsing messages from sockets, and so on. They often become the first in a series of translation stages that convert raw data in a database into objects in the application code.

<a name="chapter7">
<h1>Chapter 7 -  Error Handling</h1>
</a>

Many code bases are completely dominated by error handling. When I say dominated, I don't mean that error handling is all that they do. I mean that it is nearly impossible to see what the code does because of all of the scattered error handling. Error handling is important, but if it obscures logic, it's wrong.

### Use Exceptions Rather Than Return Codes

Back in the distant past there were many languages that didn't have exceptions. In those languages the techniques for handling and reporting errors were limited. You either set an error flag or returned an error code that the caller could check

### Write Your Try-Catch-Finally Statement First

In a way, try blocks are like transactions. Your catch has to leave your program in a consistent state, no matter what happens in the try. For this reason it is good practice to start with a try-catch-finally statement when you are writing code that could throw exceptions. This helps you define what the user of that code should expect, no matter what goes wrong with the code that is executed in the try.

### Provide Context with Exceptions

Each exception that you throw should provide enough context to determine the source and location of an error.

Create informative error messages and pass them along with your exceptions. Mention the operation that failed and the type of failure. If you are logging in your application, pass along enough information to be able to log the error in your catch.

### Don't Return Null

If you are tempted to return null from a method, consider throwing an exception or returning a SPECIAL CASE object instead. If you are calling a null-returning method from a third-party API, consider wrapping that method with a method that either throws an exception or returns a special case object.

### Don't Pass Null

Returning null from methods is bad, but passing null into methods is worse. Unless you are working with an API which expects you to pass null, you should avoid passing null in your code whenever possible.

<a name="chapter8">
<h1>Chapter 8 -  Boundaries</h1>
</a>

We seldom control all the software in our systems. Sometimes we buy third-party pack- ages or use open source. Other times we depend on teams in our own company to produce components or subsystems for us. Somehow we must cleanly integrate this foreign code with our own.

### Using Third-Party Code

There is a natural tension between the provider of an interface and the user of an interface. Providers of third-party packages and frameworks strive for broad applicability so they can work in many environments and appeal to a wide audience. Users, on the other hand, want an interface that is focused on their particular needs. This tension can cause problems at the boundaries of our systems. Example:

```java
Map sensors = new HashMap();
Sensor s = (Sensor)sensors.get(sensorId);
```

VS

```java
public class Sensors {
  private Map sensors = new HashMap();

  public Sensor getById(String id) {
    return (Sensor) sensors.get(id);
  }
  //snip
}
```

The first code exposes the casting in the Map, while the second is able to evolve with very little impact on the rest of the application. The casting and type management is handled inside the Sensors class.

The interface is also tailored and constrained to meet the needs of the application. It results in code that is easier to understand and harder to misuse. The Sensors class can enforce design and business rules.

### Exploring and Learning Boundaries

Third-party code helps us get more functionality delivered in less time. Where do we start when we want to utilize some third-party package? It’s not our job to test the third-party code, but it may be in our best interest to write tests for the third-party code we use.

It's a good idea write some test for learn and understand how to use a third-party code. Newkirk calls such tests learning tests.

### Learning Tests Are Better Than Free

The learning tests end up costing nothing. We had to learn the API anyway, and writing those tests was an easy and isolated way to get that knowledge. The learning tests were precise experiments that helped increase our understanding.

Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investment. When there are new releases of the third-party package, we run the learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences.

### Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist

Some times it's necessary work in a module that will be connected to another module under develop, and we have no idea about how to send the information, because the API had not been designed yet. In this cases it's recommendable create an interface for encapsulate the communication with the pending module. In this way we maintain the control over our module and we can test although the second module isn't available yet.

### Clean Boundaries

Interesting things happen at boundaries. Change is one of those things. Good software designs accommodate change without huge investments and rework. When we use code that is out of our control, special care must be taken to protect our investment and make sure future change is not too costly.

<h1>Chapter 9 -  Unit Tests</h1>
</a>

**T**est
**D**riven
**D**evelopment

### The Three Laws of TDD

- **First Law** You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
- **Second Law** You may not write more of a unit tests than is sufficient to fail, and not comipling is failing.
- **Third Law** You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing tests.

### Clean Tests

If you don't keep your tests clean, you will lose them.

The readability it's very important to keep clean your tests.

### One Assert per test

It's recomendable maintain only one asserts per tests, because this helps to maintain each tests easy to understand.

### Single concept per Test

This rule will help you to keep short functions.

- **Write one test per each concept that you need to verify**

### F.I.R.S.T

- **Fast** Test should be fast.
- **Independient** Test should not depend on each other.
- **Repeatable** Test Should be repeatable in any environment.
- **Self-Validating** Test should have a boolean output. either they pass or fail.
- **Timely** Unit tests should be written just before the production code that makes them pass. If you write tests after the production code, then you may find the production code to be hard to test.

<a name="chapter10">
<h1>Chapter 10 -  Classes</h1>
</a>

## Class Organization

### Encapsulation

We like to keep our variables and utility functions small, but we're not fanatic about it. Sometimes we need to make a variable or utility function protected so that it can be accessed by a test.

## Classes Should be Small

- First Rule: Classes should be small
- Second Rule: **Classes should be smaller than the first rule**

### The Single Responsibility Principle

**Classes should have one responsibility - one reason to change**

SRP is one of the more important concept in OO design. It's also one of the simple concepts to understand and adhere to.

### Cohesion

Classes Should have a small number of instance variables. Each of the methods of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables. In general the more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class. A class in which each variable is used by each method is maximally cohesive.

### Maintaining Cohesion Results in Many Small Classes

Just the act of breaking large functions into smaller functions causes a proliferation of classes.

## Organizing for change

For most systems, change is continual. Every change subjects ys to the risk that the remainder of the system no longer works as intended. In a clean system we organize our classes so as to reduce the risk of change.

### Isolating from Change

Needs will change, therefore code will change. We learned in OO 101 that there are concrete classes, which contain implementation details (code), and abstract classes, which represent concepts only. A client class depending upon concrete details is at risk when those details change. We can introduce intefaces and abstract classes to help isolate the impact of those details.

<h1>Chapter 11 -  Systems</h1>
</a>

## Separe Constructing a System from using It

_Software Systems should separate the startuo process, when the application objects are constructed and the dependencies are "wired" thogether, from the runtime logic that takes over after startup_

### Separation from main

One way to separate construction from use is simply to move all aspects of construction to `main`, or modules called by `main`, and to design the rest of the system assuming that all objects have been created constructed and wired up appropriately.

The Abstract Factory Pattern is an option for this kind of approach.

### Dependency Injection

A powerful mechanism for separating construction from use is Dependency Injection (DI), the application of Inversion of control (IoC) to dependency management. Inversion of control moves secondary responsibilities from an object to other objects that are dedicated to the purpose, thereby supporting the Single Responsibility Principle. In context of dependency management, an object should not take responsibility for instantiating dependencies itself. Instead, it, should pass this responsibility to another "authoritative" mechanism, thereby inverting the control. Because setup is a global concern, this authoritative mechanism will usually be either the "main"
routine or a special-purpose _container_.

<a name="chapter12">
<h1>Chapter 12 -  Emergence</h1>
</a>

According to Kent Beck, a design is "simple" if it follows these rules

- Run all tests
- Contains no duplication
- Expresses the intent of programmers
- Minimizes the number of classes and methods

<a name="chapter13">
<h1>Chapter 13 -  Concurrency</h1>
</a>

Concurrence is a decoupling strategy. It helps us decouple what gets fone from when it gets done. In single-threaded applications what and when are so strongly coupled that the state of the entire application can often be determined by looking at the stack backtrace. A programmer who debugs such a system can set a breakpoint, or a sequence of breakpoints, and know the state of the system by which breakpoints are hit.

Decoupling what from when can dramatically improve both the throughput and structures of an application. From a structural point of view the application looks like many lit- tle collaborating computers rather than one big main loop. This can make the system easier to understand and offers some powerful ways to separate concerns.

## Miths and Misconceptions

- Concurrency always improves performance.
  Concurrency can sometimes improve performance, but only when there is a lot of wait time that can be shared between multiple threads or multiple processors. Neither situ- ation is trivial.
- Design does not change when writing concurrent programs.
  In fact, the design of a concurrent algorithm can be remarkably different from the design of a single-threaded system. The decoupling of what from when usually has a huge effect on the structure of the system.
- Understanding concurrency issues is not important when working with a container such as a Web or EJB container.
  In fact, you’d better know just what your container is doing and how to guard against the issues of concurrent update and deadlock described later in this chapter.
  Here are a few more balanced sound bites regarding writing concurrent software:
- Concurrency incurs some overhead, both in performance as well as writing additional code.
- Correct concurrency is complex, even for simple problems.
- Concurrency bugs aren’t usually repeatable, so they are often ignored as one-offs instead of the true defects they are.
- Concurrency often requires a fundamental change in design strategy.

</a>

A reference of code smells from Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_ and Robert C Martin's _Clean Code_.

While clean code comes from discipline and not a list or value system, here is a starting point.

## Comments

#### C1: Inappropriate Information

Reserve comments for technical notes referring to code and design.

#### C2: Obsolete Comment

Update or delete obsolete comments.

#### C3: Redundant Comment

A redundant comment describes something able to sufficiently describe itself.

#### C4: Poorly Written Comment

Comments should be brief, concise, correctly spelled.

#### C5: Commented-Out Code

Ghost code. Delete it.

## Environment

#### E1: Build Requires More Than One Step

Builds should require one command to check out and one command to run.

#### E2: Tests Require More Than One Step

Tests should be run with one button click through an IDE, or else with one command.

## Functions

#### F1: Too Many Arguments

Functions should have no arguments, then one, then two, then three. No more than three.

#### F2: Output Arguments

Arguments are inputs, not outputs. If somethings state must be changed, let it be the state of the called object.

#### F3: Flag Arguments

Eliminate boolean arguments.

#### F4: Dead Function

Discard uncalled methods. This is dead code.

## General

#### G1: Multiple Languages in One Source File

Minimize the number of languages in a source file. Ideally, only one.

#### G2: Obvious Behavior is Unimplemented

The result of a function or class should not be a surprise.

#### G3: Incorrect Behavior at the Boundaries

Write tests for every boundary condition.

#### G4: Overridden Safeties

Overriding safeties and exerting manual control leads to code melt down.

#### G5: Duplication

Practice abstraction on duplicate code. Replace repetitive functions with polymorphism.

#### G6: Code at Wrong Level of Abstraction

Make sure abstracted code is separated into different containers.

#### G7: Base Classes Depending on Their Derivatives

Practice modularity.

#### G8: Too Much Information

Do a lot with a little. Limit the amount of _things_ going on in a class or functions.

#### G9: Dead Code

Delete unexecuted code.

#### G10: Vertical Separation

Define variables and functions close to where they are called.

#### G11: Inconsistency

Choose a convention, and follow it. Remember no surprises.

#### G12: Clutter

Dead code.

#### G13: Artificial Coupling

Favor code that is clear, rather than convenient. Do not group code that favors mental mapping over clearness.

#### G14: Feature Envy

Methods of one class should not be interested with the methods of another class.

#### G15: Selector Arguments

Do not flaunt false arguments at the end of functions.

#### G16: Obscured Intent

Code should not be magic or obscure.

#### G17: Misplaced Responsibility

Use clear function name as waypoints for where to place your code.

#### G18: Inappropriate Static

Make your functions nonstatic.

#### G19: Use Explanatory Variables

Make explanatory variables, and lots of them.

#### G20: Function Names Should Say What They Do

...

#### G21: Understand the Algorithm

Understand how a function works. Passing tests is not enough. Refactoring a function can lead to a better understanding of it.

#### G22: Make Logical Dependencies Physical

Understand what your code is doing.

#### G23: Prefer Polymorphism to If/Else or Switch/Case

Avoid the brute force of switch/case.

#### G24: Follow Standard Conventions

It doesn't matter what your teams convention is. Just that you have on and everyone follows it.

#### G25: Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants

Stop spelling out numbers.

#### G26: Be Precise

Don't be lazy. Think of possible results, then cover and test them.

#### G27: Structure Over Convention

Design decisions should have a structure rather than a dogma.

#### G28: Encapsulate Conditionals

Make your conditionals more precise.

#### G29: Avoid Negative Conditionals

Negative conditionals take more brain power to understand than a positive.

#### G31: Hidden Temporal Couplings

Use arguents that make temporal coupling explicit.

#### G32: Don’t Be Arbitrary

Your code's sturcture should communicate the reason for its structure.

#### G33: Encapsulate Boundary Conditions

Avoid leaking +1's and -1's into your code.

#### G34: Functions Should Descend Only One Level of Abstraction

The toughest heuristic to follow. One level of abstraction below the function's described operation can help clarify your code.

#### G35: Keep Configurable Data at High Levels

High level constants are easy to change.

#### G36: Avoid Transitive Navigation

Write shy code. Modules should only know about their neighbors, not their neighbor's neighbors.

## Names

#### N1: Choose Descriptive Names

Choose names that are descriptive and relevant.

#### N2: Choose Names at the Appropriate Level of Abstraction

Think of names that are still clear to the user when used in different programs.

#### N3: Use Standard Nomenclature Where Possible

Use names that express their task.

#### N4: Unambiguous Names

Favor clearness over curtness. A long, expressive name is better than a short, dull one.

#### N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes

A name's length should relate to its scope.

#### N6: Avoid Encodings

No not encode names with type or scope information.

#### N7: Names Should Describe Side-Effects

Consider the side-effects of your function, and include that in its name.

## Tests

#### T1: Insufficient Tests

Test everything that can possibly break

#### T2: Use a Coverage Tool!

Use your IDE as a coverage tool.

#### T3: Don’t Skip Trivial Tests

...

#### T4: An Ignored Test is a Question about an Ambiguity

If your test is ignored, the code is brought into question.

#### T5: Test Boundary Conditions

The middle is usually covered. Remember the boundaries.

#### T6: Exhaustively Test Near Bugs

Bugs are rarely alone. When you find one, look nearby for another.

#### T7: Patterns of Failure Are Revealing

Test cases ordered well will reveal patterns of faiure.

#### T8: Test Coverage Patterns Can Be Revealing

Similarly, look at the code that is or is not passed in a failure.

#### T9: Tests Should Be Fast

Slow tests won't get run.

# 3. BAD SMELLS IN CODE
### 1. Duplicated code
Same code structure in more than one place.
### 2. Long Method
The longer a procedure is the more difficult is to understand.
### 3. Large Classes
When a class is trying to do too much, duplicated code cannot be far behind.
### 4. Long Parameter List
The are hard to understand, inconsistent and difficult to use.
### 5. Divergent Change
When one class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons.
### 6. Shotgun Surgery
When every time you make a kind of change, you have to make a lot of little changes to a lot of different classes.
### 7. Feature Envy
A method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually is in.
### 8. Data Clumps
Bunches of data(fields, parameters...) that hang around together.
### 9. Primitive Obsession
Using primitives types instead of small objects.
### 10. Switch Statements
The same switch statement scattered about a program in different places. Use polymorphism.
### 11. Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies
Every time you make a subclass of one class, you also have to make a subclass of another.
### 12. Lazy Class
A class that isn't doing enough to pay for itself should be eliminated.
### 13. Speculative Generality
All sorts of hooks and special cases to handle things that aren't required.
### 14. Temporary Field
An instance variable that is set only in certain circumstances.
### 15. Message Chain
When a client asks one object for another object, which the client then asks for yet another object...
### 16. Middle Man
When an object delegates much of its functionality.
### 17. Inappropriate Intimacy
When classes access to much to another classes.
### 18. Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
Classes with methods that look to similar.
### 19. Incomplete Library Class
When we need extra features in libraries.
### 20. Data Class
Don't allow manipulation in Data Classes. Use encapsulation and immutability.
### 21. Refused Bequest
Subclasses that don't make uses of parents methods.
### 22. Comments
Not all comments but the ones that are there because the code is bad.

# 6. COMPOSING METHODS
## 1. Extract Method

You have a code fragment that can be grouped together.

```java

	void printOwing(double amount) {
		printBanner();
		//print details
		System.out.println ("name:" + _name);
		System.out.println ("amount" + amount);
	}
```

to

```java

	void printOwing(double amount) {
		printBanner();
		printDetails(amount);
	}

	void printDetails (double amount) {
		System.out.println ("name:" + _name);
	System.out.println ("amount" + amount);
	}
```

**Motivation**

* Increases the chances that other methods can use a method
* Allows the higher-level methods to read more like a series of comments

```java

	void printOwing(double previousAmount) {
		Enumeration e = _orders.elements();
		double outstanding = previousAmount * 1.2;
		printBanner();

		// calculate outstanding
		while (e.hasMoreElements()) {
			Order each = (Order) e.nextElement();
			outstanding += each.getAmount();
		}
		printDetails(outstanding);
	}
```

to

```java

	void printOwing(double previousAmount) {
		printBanner();
		double outstanding = getOutstanding(previousAmount * 1.2);
		printDetails(outstanding);
	}

	double getOutstanding(double initialValue) {
		double result = initialValue;
		Enumeration e = _orders.elements();

		while (e.hasMoreElements()) {
			Order each = (Order) e.nextElement();
			result += each.getAmount();
		}
		return result;
	}
```

## 2. Inline Method
A method's body is just as clear as its name.

```java

	int getRating() {
		return (moreThanFiveLateDeliveries()) ? 2 : 1;
	}

	boolean moreThanFiveLateDeliveries() {
		return _numberOfLateDeliveries > 5;
	}
```

to

```java

	int getRating() {
		return (_numberOfLateDeliveries > 5) ? 2 : 1;
	}
```
**Motivation**

* When Indirection is needless (simple delegation) becomes irritating.
* If group of methods are badly factored and grouping them makes it clearer


## 3. Inline Temp
You have a temp that is assigned to once with a simple expression, and the temp is getting in the way of other refactorings.

```java

	double basePrice = anOrder.basePrice();
	return (basePrice > 1000)
```

to

```java

	return (anOrder.basePrice() > 1000)
```
**Motivation**

* Use it with [4. Replace Temp with Query](#4-replace-temp-with-query)


## 4. Replace Temp with Query
You are using a temporary variable to hold the result of an expression.
```java

	double basePrice = _quantity * _itemPrice;
	if (basePrice > 1000)
		return basePrice * 0.95;
	else
		return basePrice * 0.98;
```
to

```java

	if (basePrice() > 1000)
		return basePrice() * 0.95;
	else
		return basePrice() * 0.98;
	...
	double basePrice() {
		return _quantity * _itemPrice;
	}
```

**Motivation**

* Replacing the temp with a query method, any method in the class can get at the information.
* Is a vital step before [1. Extract Method](#1-extract-method)

## 5. Introduce Explaining Variable
You have a complicated expression
```java

	if ( (platform.toUpperCase().indexOf("MAC") > -1) &&
		(browser.toUpperCase().indexOf("IE") > -1) &&
		wasInitialized() && resize > 0 )
	{
		// do something
	}
```
to

```java

	final boolean isMacOs = platform.toUpperCase().indexOf("MAC") >-1;
	final boolean isIEBrowser = browser.toUpperCase().indexOf("IE") >-1;
	final boolean wasResized = resize > 0;
	if (isMacOs && isIEBrowser && wasInitialized() && wasResized) {
		// do something
	}

```

**Motivation**

* When expressions are hard to read

## 6. Split Temporary Variable
You have a temporary variable assigned to more than once, but is not a loop variable nor a collecting temporary variable.

```java

	double temp = 2 * (_height + _width);
	System.out.println (temp);
	temp = _height * _width;
	System.out.println (temp);
```
to
```java

	final double perimeter = 2 * (_height + _width);
	System.out.println (perimeter);
	final double area = _height * _width;
	System.out.println (area);
```

**Motivation**

* Variables should not have more than one responsibility.
* Using a temp for two different things is very confusing for the reader.

## 7. Remove Assignments to Parameters
The code assign to a parameter
```java

	int discount (int inputVal, int quantity, int yearToDate) {
		if (inputVal > 50) inputVal -= 2;
```
to
```java

	int discount (int inputVal, int quantity, int yearToDate) {
		int result = inputVal;
		if (inputVal > 50) result -= 2;
```

**Motivation**

* You can change the internals of  object is passed but do not point to another object.
* Use only the parameter to represent what has been passed.

## 8. Replace Method with Method Object
You have a long method that uses local variables in such a way that you cannot apply Extract Method.

```java

	class Order...
		double price() {
			double primaryBasePrice;
			double secondaryBasePrice;
			double tertiaryBasePrice;
			// long computation;
			...
		}
```
to
```java

	class Order...
		double price(){
			return new PriceCalculator(this).compute()
		}
	}

	class PriceCalculato...
	compute(){
		double primaryBasePrice;
		double secondaryBasePrice;
		double tertiaryBasePrice;
		// long computation;
		return ...
	}

```

**Motivation**

* When a method has lot of local variables and applying decomposition is not possible

_This sample does not really needs this refactoring, but shows the way to do it._
```java

	Class Account
		int gamma (int inputVal, int quantity, int yearToDate) {
			int importantValue1 = (inputVal * quantity) + delta();
			int importantValue2 = (inputVal * yearToDate) + 100;
			if ((yearToDate - importantValue1) > 100)
			importantValue2 -= 20;
			int importantValue3 = importantValue2 * 7;
			// and so on.
			return importantValue3 - 2 * importantValue1;
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	class Gamma...
		private final Account _account;
		private int inputVal;
		private int quantity;
		private int yearToDate;
		private int importantValue1;
		private int importantValue2;
		private int importantValue3;

		Gamma (Account source, int inputValArg, int quantityArg, int yearToDateArg) {
			_account = source;
			inputVal = inputValArg;
			quantity = quantityArg;
			yearToDate = yearToDateArg;
		}

		int compute () {
			importantValue1 = (inputVal * quantity) + _account.delta();
			importantValue2 = (inputVal * yearToDate) + 100;
			if ((yearToDate - importantValue1) > 100)
			importantValue2 -= 20;
			int importantValue3 = importantValue2 * 7;
			// and so on.
			return importantValue3 - 2 * importantValue1;
		}

		int gamma (int inputVal, int quantity, int yearToDate) {
			return new Gamma(this, inputVal, quantity,yearToDate).compute();
		}
```

## 9. Substitute Algorithm
You want to replace an algorithm with one that is clearer.

```java

	String foundPerson(String[] people){
		for (int i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
			if (people[i].equals ("Don")){
				return "Don";
			}
			if (people[i].equals ("John")){
				return "John";
			}
			if (people[i].equals ("Kent")){
				return "Kent";
			}
		}
		return "";
	}
```
to
```java

	String foundPerson(String[] people){
		List candidates = Arrays.asList(new String[] {"Don", "John","Kent"});
	for (int i = 0; i<people.length; i++)
		if (candidates.contains(people[i]))
			return people[i];
	return "";
	}
```

**Motivation**

* Break down something complex into simpler pieces.
* Makes easier apply changes to the algorithm.
* Substituting a large, complex algorithm is very difficult; making it simple can make the substitution tractable.


# 7. Moving features between elements
## 10. Move method
A method is, or will be, using or used by more features of another class than the class on which it is defined.  

_Create a new method with a similar body in the class it uses most. Either turn the old method into a simple delegation, or remove it altogether._  

```java

	class Class1 {
		aMethod()
	}

	class Class2 {	}
```
to


```java

	class Class1 {	}

	class Class2 {
		aMethod()
	}
```

**Motivation**

When classes do to much work or when collaborate too much and are highly coupled

## 11. Move field
A field is, or will be, used by another class more than the class on which it is defined.
_Create a new field in the target class, and change all its users._

```java

	class Class1 {
		aField
	}

	class Class2 {	}
```
to


```java

	class Class1 {	}

	class Class2 {
		aField
	}
```

**Motivation**

If a field is used mostly by outer classes and before [12. Extract Class](#12-extract-class)


## 12. Extract Class
You have one class doing work that should be done by two.
_Create a new class and move the relevant fields and methods from the old class into the new class._
```java

	class Person {
		name,
		officeAreaCode,
		officeNumber,
		getTelephoneNumber()
	}
```
to
```java

	class Person {
		name,
		getTelephoneNumber()
	}

	class TelephoneNumber {
		areaCode,
		number,
		getTelephoneNumber()
	}
```

**Motivation**

Classes grow.
_Split them when_:

* subsets of methods seem to be together
* subsets of data usually change together or depend on each other

## 13. Inline Class
A class isn't doing very much.
_Move all its features into another class and delete it._
```java

	class Person {
		name,
		getTelephoneNumber()
	}

	class TelephoneNumber {
		areaCode,
		number,
		getTelephoneNumber()
	}
```
to
```java

	class Person {
		name,
		officeAreaCode,
		officeNumber,
		getTelephoneNumber()
	}
```


**Motivation**

After refactoring normally there are a bunch of responsibilities moved out of the class, letting the class with little left.

## 14. Hide Delegate
A client is calling a delegate class of an object.  
_Create methods on the server to hide the delegate._
```java

	class ClientClass {
		//Dependencies
		Person person = new Person()
		Department department = new Department()
		person.doSomething()
		department.doSomething()
	}
```
to
```java

	class ClientClass {
		Person person = new Person()
		person.doSomething()
	}

	class Person{
		Department department = new Department()
		department.doSomething()
	}
```

_The solution_
```java

	class ClientClass{
		Server server = new Server()
		server.doSomething()
	}

	class Server{
		Delegate delegate = new Delegate()
		void doSomething(){
			delegate.doSomething()
		}
	}
	// The delegate is hidden to the client class.
	// Changes won't be propagated to the client they will only affect the server
	class Delegate{
		void doSomething(){...}
	}

```

**Motivation**

Key of encapsulation.
Classes should know as less as possible of other classes.

`> manager = john.getDepartment().getManager();`
```java



	class Person {
		Department _department;
		public Department getDepartment() {
			return _department;
		}
		public void setDepartment(Department arg) {
			_department = arg;
			}
		}

	class Department {
		private String _chargeCode;
		private Person _manager;
		public Department (Person manager) {
			_manager = manager;
		}
		public Person getManager() {
			return _manager;
		}
		...
```
to

`> manager = john.getManager();`
```java

	class Person {
		...
		public Person getManager() {
			return _department.getManager();
		}
	}
```

## 15. Remove Middle Man
A class is doing too much simple delegation.
_Get the client to call the delegate directly._
```java

	class ClientClass {
		Person person = new Person()
		person.doSomething()
	}

	class Person{
		Department department = new Department()
		department.doSomething()
	}
```
to

```java

	class ClientClass {
		//Dependencies
		Person person = new Person()
		Department department = new Department()
		person.doSomething()
		department.doSomething()
	}
```


**Motivation**

When the "Middle man" (the server) does to much is time for the client to call the delegate directly.

## 16. Introduce Foreign Method
A server class you are using needs an additional method, but you can't modify the class.  
_Create a method in the client class with an instance of the server class as its first argument._

```java

	Date newStart = new Date(previousEnd.getYear(),previousEnd.getMonth(),previousEnd.getDate()+1);
```
to
```java

	Date newStart = nextDay(previousEnd);

	private static Date nextDay(Date date){
		return new Date(date.getYear(),date.getMonth(),date.getDate()+1);
	}
```

**Motivation**

When there is a lack of a method in class that you use a lot and you can not change that class.

## 17. Introduce Local Extension
A server class you are using needs several additional methods, but you can't modify the class.
_Create a new class that contains these extra methods. Make this extension class a subclass or a wrapper of the original._
```java

	class ClientClass(){

		Date date = new Date()
		nextDate = nextDay(date);

		private static Date nextDay(Date date){
			return new Date(date.getYear(),date.getMonth(),date.getDate()+1);
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	class ClientClass() {
		MfDate date = new MfDate()
		nextDate = nextDate(date)
	}
	class MfDate() extends Date {
		...
		private static Date nextDay(Date date){
			return new Date(date.getYear(),date.getMonth(),date.getDate()+1);
		}
	}
```

**Motivation**

When plenty of [16. Introduce Foreign Method](#16-introduce-foreign-method) need to be added to a class.


# 8. ORGANIZING DATA
## 18. Self Encapsulate Field
You are accessing a field directly, but the coupling to the field is becoming awkward.   
_Create getting and setting methods for the field and use only those to access the field._  
```java

	private int _low, _high;
	boolean includes (int arg) {
		return arg >= _low && arg <= _high;
	}
```
to

```java

	private int _low, _high;
	boolean includes (int arg) {
		return arg >= getLow() && arg <= getHigh();
	}
	int getLow() {return _low;}
	int getHigh() {return _high;}
```

**Motivation**  
Allows a subclass to override how to get that information with a method and that it supports more flexibility in managing the data, such as lazy initialization.

## 19. Replace Data Value with Object
You have a data item that needs additional data or behavior.  
_Turn the data item into an object_

```java

	class Order...{
		private String _customer;
		public Order (String customer) {
			_customer = customer;
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	class Order...{
		public Order (String customer) {
			_customer = new Customer(customer);
		}
	}

	class Customer {
		public Customer (String name) {
			_name = name;
		}
	}
```
**Motivation**  
Simple data items  aren't so simple anymore.

## 20. Change Value to Reference
You have a class with many equal instances that you want to replace with a single object.  
_Turn the object into a reference object._
```java

	class Order...{
		public Order (String customer) {
			_customer = new Customer(customer);
		}
	}

	class Customer {
		public Customer (String name) {
			_name = name;
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	//Use Factory Method
	class Customer...
		static void loadCustomers() {
			new Customer ("Lemon Car Hire").store();
			new Customer ("Associated Coffee Machines").store();
			new Customer ("Bilston Gasworks").store();
		}
		private void store() {
			_instances.put(this.getName(), this);
		}
		public static Customer create (String name) {
			return (Customer) _instances.get(name);
		}
```
**Motivation**  
Reference objects are things like customer or account. Each object stands for one object in the real world, and you use the object identity to test whether they are equal.

## 21. Change Reference to Value
You have a reference object that is small, immutable, and awkward to manage.  
_Turn it into a value object_
```java

	new Currency("USD").equals(new Currency("USD")) // returns false
```
to
```java
	
	// Add `equals` and `hashCode` to the Currency class 
	class Currency{ 
		...
		public boolean equals(Object arg) {
	 		if (! (arg instanceof Currency)) return false;
	 		Currency other = (Currency) arg;
			return (_code.equals(other._code));
		}

		public int hashCode() {
 			return _code.hashCode();
 		}
 	}

 	// Now you can do
	new Currency("USD").equals(new Currency("USD")) // now returns true
```
**Motivation**  
Working with the reference object becomes awkward. The reference object is immutable and small. Used in distributed or concurrent systems.

## 22. Replace Array with Object
You have an array in which certain elements mean different things.  
_Replace the array with an object that has a field for each element_
```java

	String[] row = new String[3];
	row [0] = "Liverpool";
	row [1] = "15";
```
to
```java

	Performance row = new Performance();
	row.setName("Liverpool");
	row.setWins("15");
```
**Motivation**  
Arrays should be used only to contain a collection of similar objects in some order.

## 23. Duplicate Observed Data
You have domain data available only in a GUI control, and domain methods need access.  
_Copy the data to a domain object. Set up an observer to synchronize the two pieces of data_  
**Motivation**  
 To separate code that handles the user interface from code that handles the business logic.
## 24. Change Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional
You have two classes that need to use each other's features, but there is only a one-way link.  
_Add back pointers, and change modifiers to update both sets_
```java

	class Order...
		Customer getCustomer() {
			return _customer;
		}
		void setCustomer (Customer arg) {
			_customer = arg;
		}
		Customer _customer;
	}
```
to
```java

	class Order...
		Customer getCustomer() {
			return _customer;
		}
		void setCustomer (Customer arg) {
			if (_customer != null) _customer.friendOrders().remove(this);
			_customer = arg;
			if (_customer != null) _customer.friendOrders().add(this);
		}
		private Customer _customer;

		class Customer...
			void addOrder(Order arg) {
				arg.setCustomer(this);
			}
			private Set _orders = new HashSet();

			Set friendOrders() {
				/** should only be used by Order */
				return _orders;
			}
		}
	}

	// Many to Many
	class Order... //controlling methods
		void addCustomer (Customer arg) {
			arg.friendOrders().add(this);
			_customers.add(arg);
		}
		void removeCustomer (Customer arg) {
			arg.friendOrders().remove(this);
			_customers.remove(arg);
		}
	class Customer...
		void addOrder(Order arg) {
			arg.addCustomer(this);
		}
		void removeOrder(Order arg) {
			arg.removeCustomer(this);
		}
	}
```
**Motivation**  
When the object referenced needs access access to the object that refer to it.

## 25. Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional
You have a two-way association but one class no longer needs features from the other.  
_Drop the unneeded end of the association_  
**Motivation**  
If Bidirectional association is not needed, reduce complexity, handle zombie objects, eliminate interdependency
## 26. Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant
You have a literal number with a particular meaning.  
_Create a constant, name it after the meaning, and replace the number with it_
```java

	double potentialEnergy(double mass, double height) {
		return mass * 9.81 * height;
	}
```
to
```java

	double potentialEnergy(double mass, double height) {
		return mass * GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT * height;
	}
	static final double GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT = 9.81;
```
**Motivation**  
Avoid using Magic numbers.

## 27. Encapsulate Field
There is a public field.  
_Make it private and provide accessors_
```java

	public String _name
```
to
```java

	private String _name;
	public String getName() {return _name;}
	public void setName(String arg) {_name = arg;}
```
**Motivation**  
You should never make your data public.

## 28. Encapsulate Collection
A method returns a collection.  
_Make it return a read-only view and provide add/remove methods_
```java

	class Person {
		Person (String name){
			HashSet set new HashSet()
		}
		Set getCourses(){}
		void setCourses(:Set){}
	}
```
to
```java

	class Person {
		Person (String name){
			HashSet set new HashSet()
		}
		Unmodifiable Set getCourses(){}
		void addCourses(:Course){}
		void removeCourses(:Course){}
	}
```
**Motivation**   
* Encapsulated reduce the coupling of the owning class to its clients.
* The getter should not return the collection object itself.
* The getter should return something that prevents manipulation of the collection and hides unnecessary details.
* There should not be a setter for collection, only operations to add and remove elements.

## 29. Remove Record with data class
You need to interface with a record structure in a traditional programming environment.  
_Make a dumb data object for the record._

**Motivation**  
* Copying a legacy program
* Communicating a structured record with a traditional programming API or database.
## 30. Replace Type Code with Class
A class has a numeric type code that does not affect its behavior.  
_Replace the number with a new class._
```java

	class Person{
		O:Int;
		A:Int;
		B:Int;
		AB:Int;
		bloodGroup:Int;
	}
```
to
```java

	class Person{
		bloodGroup:BloodGroup;
	}

	class BloodGroup{
		O:BloodGroup;
		A:BloodGroup;
		B:BloodGroup;
		AB:BloodGroup;
	}
```
**Motivation**  
Statically type checking.

## 31. Replace Type Code with Subclasses
You have an immutable type code that affects the behavior of a class.  
_Replace the type code with subclasses._
```java

	class Employee...
		private int _type;

		static final int ENGINEER = 0;
		static final int SALESMAN = 1;
		static final int MANAGER = 2;

		Employee (int type) {
			_type = type;
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	abstract int getType();
	static Employee create(int type) {
		switch (type) {
			case ENGINEER:
				return new Engineer();
			case SALESMAN:
				return new Salesman();
			case MANAGER:
				return new Manager();
			default:
				throw new IllegalArgumentException("Incorrect type code value");
		}
	}
```
**Motivation**  

* Execute different code depending on the value of a type.
* When each type code object has unique features.
* Structure to implement [38. Replace Conditional with Polymorphism](#38-replace-conditional-with-polymorphism)
* Use of [30. Replace Type Code with Class](#30-replace-type-code-with-class)

## 32. Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
You have a type code that affects the behavior of a class, but you cannot use subclassing.  
_Replace the type code with a state object_
```java

	class Employee {
		private int _type;

		static final int ENGINEER = 0;
		static final int SALESMAN = 1;
		static final int MANAGER = 2;

		Employee (int type) {
			_type = type;
		}
		int payAmount() {
			switch (_type) {
				case ENGINEER:
					return _monthlySalary;
				case SALESMAN:
					return _monthlySalary + _commission;
				case MANAGER:
					return _monthlySalary + _bonus;
				default:
					throw new RuntimeException("Incorrect Employee");
				}
			}
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	class Employee...
		static final int ENGINEER = 0;
		static final int SALESMAN = 1;
		static final int MANAGER = 2;

		void setType(int arg) {
			_type = EmployeeType.newType(arg);
		}
		class EmployeeType...
			static EmployeeType newType(int code) {
				switch (code) {
					case ENGINEER:
						return new Engineer();
					case SALESMAN:
						return new Salesman();
					case MANAGER:
						return new Manager();
					default:
						throw new IllegalArgumentException("Incorrect Employee Code");
				}
			}
		}
		int payAmount() {
			switch (getType()) {
				case EmployeeType.ENGINEER:
					return _monthlySalary;
				case EmployeeType.SALESMAN:
					return _monthlySalary + _commission;
				case EmployeeType.MANAGER:
					return _monthlySalary + _bonus;
				default:
					throw new RuntimeException("Incorrect Employee");
			}
		}
	}
```
**Motivation**  

* Similar to [31. Replace Type Code with Subclasses](#31-replace-type-code-with-subclasses), but can be used if the type code changes during the life of the object or if another reason prevents subclassing.
* It uses either the state or strategy pattern

## 32. Replace Subclass with Fields
You have subclasses that vary only in methods that return constant data.  
_Change the methods to superclass fields and eliminate the subclasses_
```java

	abstract class Person {
		abstract boolean isMale();
		abstract char getCode();
		...
	}
	class Male extends Person {
			boolean isMale() {
			return true;
		}
		char getCode() {
			return 'M';
		}
	}
	class Female extends Person {
		boolean isMale() {
			return false;
		}
		char getCode() {
			return 'F';
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	class Person{
		protected Person (boolean isMale, char code) {
			_isMale = isMale;
			_code = code;
		}
		boolean isMale() {
			return _isMale;
		}
		static Person createMale(){
			return new Person(true, 'M');
		}
		static Person createFemale(){
			return new Person(false, 'F');
		}
	}
```
**Motivation**  

* Subclasses that consists only of constant methods is not doing enough to be worth existing.
* Remove such subclasses completely by putting fields in the superclass.
* Remove the extra complexity of the subclasses.

# 9. SIMPLIFYING CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS

## 33. Decompose Conditional
You have a complicated conditional (if-then-else) statement.     
_Extract methods from the condition, then part, and else parts_
```java

	if (date.before (SUMMER_START) || date.after(SUMMER_END))
		charge = quantity * _winterRate + _winterServiceCharge;
	else charge = quantity * _summerRate;
```
to
```java

	if (notSummer(date))
		charge = winterCharge(quantity);
	else charge = summerCharge (quantity);
```
**Motivation**  

* Highlight the condition and make it clearly what you are branching on.
* Highlight the reason for the branching

## 34. Consolidate Conditional Expression
You have a sequence of conditional tests with the same result.  
_Combine them into a single conditional expression and extract it_
```java

	double disabilityAmount() {
	if (_seniority < 2) return 0;
	if (_monthsDisabled > 12) return 0;
	if (_isPartTime) return 0;
	// compute the disability amount
```
to
```java

	double disabilityAmount() {
	if (isNotEligableForDisability()) return 0;
	// compute the disability amount
```
**Motivation**  

* Makes the check clearer by showing that you are really making a single check
* Sets you up for [1. Extract Method](#1-extract-method).
* Clarify your code (replaces a statement of what you are doing with why you are doing it.)

## 35. Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments
The same fragment of code is in all branches of a conditional expression.  
_Move it outside of the expression._
```java

	if (isSpecialDeal()) {
		total = price * 0.95;
		send();
	}
	else {
		total = price * 0.98;
		send();
	}
```
to
```java

	if (isSpecialDeal()) {
		total = price * 0.95;
	}
	else {
		total = price * 0.98;
	}
	send();

```
**Motivation**  
Makes clearer what varies and what stays the same.

## 36. Remove Control Flag
You have a variable that is acting as a control flag for a series of boolean expressions.  
_Use a break or return instead_
```java

	void checkSecurity(String[] people) {
		boolean found = false;
			for (int i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
				if (! found) {
					if (people[i].equals ("Don")){
						sendAlert();
						found = true;
					}
					if (people[i].equals ("John")){
						sendAlert();
						found = true;
					}
				}
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	void checkSecurity(String[] people) {
		for (int i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
			if (people[i].equals ("Don")){
				sendAlert();
				break; // or return
			}
			if (people[i].equals ("John")){
				sendAlert();
				break; // or return
			}
		}
	}
```
**Motivation**  

* Control flag are used to determine when to stop looking, but modern languages enforce the use of `break` and `continue`
* Make the real purpose of the conditional much more clear.

## 37. Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses
A method has conditional behavior that does not make clear the normal path of execution.  
_Use guard clauses for all the special cases_
```java

	double getPayAmount() {
		double result;
		if (_isDead) result = deadAmount();
		else {
			if (_isSeparated) result = separatedAmount();
			else {
				if (_isRetired) result = retiredAmount();
				else result = normalPayAmount();
			};
		}
		return result;
	};
```
to
```java

	double getPayAmount() {
		if (_isDead) return deadAmount();
		if (_isSeparated) return separatedAmount();
		if (_isRetired) return retiredAmount();
		return normalPayAmount();
	};
```
**Motivation**  

* If the condition is an unusual condition, check the condition and return if the condition is true.
* This kind of check is often called a **guard clause** [Beck].
* If you are using an if-then-else construct you are giving equal weight to the if leg and the else leg.
* This communicates to the reader that the legs are equally likely and important.
* Instead the **guard clause** says, _"This is rare, and if it happens, do something and get out."_

## 38. Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
You have a conditional that chooses different behavior depending on the type of an object.   
_Move each leg of the conditional to an overriding method in a subclass. Make the original method abstract_
```java

	class Employee {
		private int _type;

		static final int ENGINEER = 0;
		static final int SALESMAN = 1;
		static final int MANAGER = 2;

		Employee (int type) {
			_type = type;
		}
		int payAmount() {
			switch (_type) {
				case ENGINEER:
					return _monthlySalary;
				case SALESMAN:
					return _monthlySalary + _commission;
				case MANAGER:
					return _monthlySalary + _bonus;
				default:
					throw new RuntimeException("Incorrect Employee");
				}
			}
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	class Employee...
		static final int ENGINEER = 0;
		static final int SALESMAN = 1;
		static final int MANAGER = 2;

		void setType(int arg) {
			_type = EmployeeType.newType(arg);
		}
		int payAmount() {
			return _type.payAmount(this);
		}
	}

	class Engineer...
		int payAmount(Employee emp) {
			return emp.getMonthlySalary();
		}
	}
```
**Motivation**  

* Avoid writing an explicit conditional when you have objects whose behavior varies depending on their types.
* Switch statements should be less common in object oriented programs

## 39. Introduce Null Object
You have repeated checks for a null value.  
_Replace the null value with a null object_
```java

	if (customer == null) plan = BillingPlan.basic();
	else plan = customer.getPlan();
```
to
```java

	class Customer {}

	class NullCusomer extends Customer {}
```
**Motivation**

* The object, depending on its type, does the right thing. Null objects should also apply this rule.
* Use **Null Object Pattern** is the little brother of **Special Case Pattern**.

## 40. Introduce Assertion
A section of code assumes something about the state of the program.  
_Make the assumption explicit with an assertion_
```java

	double getExpenseLimit() {
		// should have either expense limit or a primary project
		return (_expenseLimit != NULL_EXPENSE) ?
			_expenseLimit:
			_primaryProject.getMemberExpenseLimit();
	}
```
to
```java

	double getExpenseLimit() {
		Assert.isTrue (_expenseLimit != NULL_EXPENSE || _primaryProject	!= null);
		return (_expenseLimit != NULL_EXPENSE) ?
			_expenseLimit:
			_primaryProject.getMemberExpenseLimit();
	}
```
**Motivation**  

* Assertions are conditional statements that are assumed to be always true.
* Assertion failures should always result in unchecked exceptions.
* Assertions usually are removed for production code.
* As communication  aids: they help the reader understand the assumptions the code is making.
* As debugging aids: assertions can help catch bugs closer to their origin.

# 10. MAKING METHOD CALLS SIMPLER
## 41. Rename method
The name of a method does not reveal its purpose.  
_Change the name of the method_
```java
	getinvcdtlmt()
```
to
```java
	getInvoiceableCreditLimit
```
**Motivation**   
Methods names must communicate their intention.

## 42. Add Parameter
A method needs more information from its caller.  
_Add a parameter for an object that can pass on this information_
```java
	getContact()
```
to
```java
	getContact(:Date)
```
**Motivation**    
After changed a method you require more information.
## 43. Remove Parameter
A parameter is no longer used by the method body.  
_Remove it_
```java
	getContact(:Date)
```
to
```java
	getContact()
```
**Motivation**    
A parameter is no more needed.

## 44. Separate Query from Modifier
You have a method that returns a value but also changes the state of an object.  
_Create two methods, one for the query and one for the modification_
```java
	getTotalOutStandingAndSetReadyForSummaries()
```
to
```java
	getTotalOutStanding()
	SetReadyForSummaries()
```
**Motivation**    
Signaling methods with side effects and those without.
## 45. Parameterize Method
Several methods do similar things but with different values contained in the method body.  
_Create one method that uses a parameter for the different values_
```java
	fivePercentRaise()
	tenPercentRaise()
```
to
```java
	raise(percentage)
```
**Motivation**    
Removes duplicate code and increases flexibility.
## 46. Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods
You have a method that runs different code depending on the values of an enumerated parameter.  
_Create a separate method for each value of the parameter_
```java

	void setValue (String name, int value) {
		if (name.equals("height")){}
			_height = value;
			return;
		}
		if (name.equals("width")){
			_width = value;
			return;
		}
		Assert.shouldNeverReachHere();
	}
```
to
```java

	void setHeight(int arg) {
		_height = arg;
	}
	void setWidth (int arg) {
		_width = arg;
	}
```
**Motivation**

* Avoid the conditional behavior
* Gain compile time checking
* Clearer Interface

## 47. Preserve Whole Object
You are getting several values from an object and passing these values as parameters in a method call.  
_Send the whole object instead_
```java

	int low = daysTempRange().getLow();
	int high = daysTempRange().getHigh();
	withinPlan = plan.withinRange(low, high);
```
to
```java

	withinPlan = plan.withinRange(daysTempRange());
```
**Motivation**

* Make parameters list robust to changes
* Make code more readeable
* Remove possible duplicate code already done in the object passed
* Negative: It creates a dependency between the parameter object and the called.

## 48. Replace Parameter with Method
An object invokes a method, then passes the result as a parameter for a method. The receiver can also invoke this method.  
_Remove the parameter and let the receiver invoke the method_
```java

	int basePrice = _quantity * _itemPrice;
	discountLevel = getDiscountLevel();
	double finalPrice = discountedPrice (basePrice, discountLevel);
```
to
```java

	int basePrice = _quantity * _itemPrice;
	double finalPrice = discountedPrice (basePrice);
```
**Motivation**

* If a method can get a value that is passed in as parameter by another means, it should.
* If the receiving method can make the same calculation (does not reference any of the parameters of the calling method)
* If you are calling a method on a different object that has a reference to the calling object.

## 49. Introduce Parameter Object
You have a group of parameters that naturally go together.  
_Replace them with an object_
```java

	class Customer{
		amountInvoicedIn (start : Date, end : Date)
		amountReceivedIn (start : Date, end : Date)
		amountOverdueIn (start : Date, end : Date)
	}
```
to
```java

	class Customer{
		amountInvoicedIn (: DateRange)
		amountReceivedIn (: DateRange)
		amountOverdueIn (: DateRange)
	}
```
**Motivation**

* Reduces the size of the parameter list
* Make the code more consistent

## 50. Remove Setting Method
A field should be set at creation time and never altered.  
_Remove any setting method for that field_
```java

	class Employee{
		setImmutableValue()
	}
```
to
```java

	class Employee{
		¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	}
```
**Motivation**   
Make your intention  clear: If you don't want that field to change once is created, then don't provide a setting method (and make the field final).

## 51. Hide Method
A method is not used by any other class.  
_Make the method private_
```java

	class Employee{
		public method()
	}
```
to
```java

	class Employee{
		private method()
	}
```
**Motivation**   
Whenever a method is not needed outside its class it should be hidden

## 52. Replace Constructor with Factory Method
You want to do more than simple construction when you create an object.  
_Replace the constructor with a factory method_
```java

	Employee (int type) {
		_type = type;
	}
```
to
```java

	static Employee create(int type) {
		return new Employee(type);
	}
```
**Motivation**   
Create an object depending on its subclasses  (types). Constructors can only return an instance of the object that is asked for so a Factory method is needed.

## 53. Encapsulate Downcast
A method returns an object that needs to be downcasted by its callers.  
_Move the downcast to within the method_

```java

	Object lastReading() {
		return readings.lastElement();
	}
```
to
```java

	Reading lastReading() {
		return (Reading) readings.lastElement();
	}
```
**Motivation**   
Provide as result type, the most specific type of the method signature.      
If the signature is to general, check the uses the clients do of that method and if coherent, provide a more specific one.

## 54. Replace Error Code with Exception
A method returns a special code to indicate an error.   
_Throw an exception instead_
```java

	int withdraw(int amount) {
		if (amount > _balance)
			return -1;
		else {
			_balance -= amount;
			return 0;
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	void withdraw(int amount) throws BalanceException {
		if (amount > _balance)
			throw new BalanceException();
		_balance -= amount;
	}
```
**Motivation**
When a program that spots an error can't figure out what to do about it. It needs to let its caller know, and the caller may pass the error up the chain.
## 55. Replace Exception with Test
You are throwing a checked exception on a condition the caller could have checked first.   
_Change the caller to make the test first_
```java

	double getValueForPeriod (int periodNumber) {
		try {
			return _values[periodNumber];
		} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
			return 0;
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	double getValueForPeriod (int periodNumber) {
		if (periodNumber >= _values.length)
			return 0;
		return _values[periodNumber];
}
```
**Motivation**

* Do not overuse Exceptions they should be used for exceptional behavior (behavior that is unexpected).
* Do not use them as substitute for conditional tests.
* Check expected wrong conditions before before calling the operation.

# 11. DEALING WITH GENERALIZATION
## 56. Pull up field
Two subclasses have the same field.   
_Move the field to the superclass_   
```java

	class Salesman extends Employee{
		String name;
	}
	class Engineer extends Employee{
		String name;
	}
```
to
```java

	class Employee{
		String name;
	}
	class Salesman extends Employee{}
	class Engineer extends Employee{}

```
**Motivation**

* Removes the duplicate data declaration.
* Allows  to move  behavior from the subclasses to the superclass.

## 57. Pull Up Method
You have methods with identical results on subclasses.   
_Move them to the superclass_
```java

	class Salesman extends Employee{
		String getName();
	}
	class Engineer extends Employee{
		String getName();
	}
```
to
```java

	class Employee{
		String getName();
	}
	class Salesman extends Employee{}
	class Engineer extends Employee{}

```
**Motivation**

* Eliminates duplicated behavior.

## 58. Pull Up Constructor Body
You have constructors on subclasses with mostly identical bodies.  
_Create a superclass constructor; call this from the subclass methods_  
```java

	class Manager extends Employee...
		public Manager (String name, String id, int grade) {
		_name = name;
		_id = id;
		_grade = grade;
	}

```
to
```java

	public Manager (String name, String id, int grade) {
		super (name, id);
		_grade = grade;
	}
```
**Motivation**

* Constructors are not the same as methods.
* Eliminates duplicated behavior.

## 59. Push Down Method
Behavior on a superclass is relevant only for some of its subclasses.   
_Move it to those subclasses._   
```java

	class Employee{
		int getQuota();
	}
	class Salesman extends Employee{}
	class Engineer extends Employee{}
```
to
```java

	class Salesman extends Employee{
		int getQuota();
	}
	class Engineer extends Employee{}
```
**Motivation**
When a method makes only sense in the subclass.
## 60. Push Down Field
A field is used only by some subclasses.  
_Move the field to those subclasses_
```java

	class Employee{
		int quota;
	}
	class Salesman extends Employee{}
	class Engineer extends Employee{}
```
to
```java

	class Salesman extends Employee{
		int quota;
	}
	class Engineer extends Employee{}
```
**Motivation**
When a field makes only sense in the subclass.
## 61. Extract Subclass
A class has features that are used only in some instances.  
_Create a subclass for that subset of features_  
```java

	class JobItem	{
		getTotalPrices()
		getUnitPrice()
		getEmployee()
	}
```
to
```java

	JobItem	{
		getTotalPrices()
		getUnitPrice()
	}
	class class LabotItem extends JobItem	{
		getUnitPrice()
		getEmployee()
	}
```
**Motivation**
When a class has behavior used for some instances of the class and not for others.
## 62. Extract Superclass
You have two classes with similar features.   
_Create a superclass and move the common features to the superclass_  
```java

	class Department{
		getTotalAnnualCost()
		getName()
		getHeadCount
	}
	class Employee{
		getAnnualCost()
		getName()
		getId
	}

```
to
```java

	class Party{
		getAnnualCost()
		getName()
	}
	class Department {
		getAnnualCost()
		getHeadCount
	}
	class Employee {
		getAnnualCost()
		getId
	}

```
**Motivation**	 
When two classes that do similar things in the same way or similar things in different ways.
## 63. Extract Interface
Several clients use the same subset of a class's interface, or two classes have part of their interfaces in common.  
_Extract the subset into an interface_  
```java

	class Employee {
		getRate()
		hasSpecialSkill()
		getName()
		getDepartment()
	}
```
to
```java

	interface Billable	{
		getRate()
		hasSpecialSkill()
	}
	class Employee implements Billable	{
		getRate
		hasSpecialSkill()
		getName()
		getDepartment()
	}
```	
**Motivation**

* If only a particular subset of a class's responsibilities is used by a group of clients.
* If a class needs to work with any class that can handle certain requests.
* Whenever a class has distinct roles in different situations.

## 64. Collapse Hierarchy
A superclass and subclass are not very different.   
_Merge them together_
```java

	class Employee{	}
	class Salesman extends Employee{	}
```
to
```java

	class Employee{	}
```		
**Motivation**	 
When a subclass that isn't adding any value.
## 65. Form Template Method
You have two methods in subclasses that perform similar steps in the same order, yet the steps are different.
_Get the steps into methods with the same signature, so that the original methods become the same. Then you can pull them up_
```java

	class Site{}
	class ResidentialSite extends Site{
		getBillableAmount()
	}
	class LifelineSite extends Site{
		getBillableAmount()
	}
```
to
```java

	class Site{ 	
		getBillableAmount()
		getBaseAmount()
		getTaxAmount()
	}
	class ResidentialSite extends Site{
		getBaseAmount()
		getTaxAmount()
	}
	class LifelineSite extends Site{
		getBaseAmount()
		getTaxAmount()
	}
```
**Motivation**

* Use Inheritance with polymorphism  for eliminating duplicate behavior that is slightly different.
* When there are two similar methods in a subclass, bring them together in a superclass.
* [Template Method](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Template_method_pattern)[[Gang of Four]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Design_Patterns)

## 66. Replace Inheritance with Delegation
A subclass uses only part of a superclasses interface or does not want to inherit data.  
_Create a field for the superclass, adjust methods to delegate to the superclass, and remove the subclassing_
```java

	class Vector{
		isEmpty()
	}

	class Stack extends Vector {}

```
to
```java

	class Vector {
		isEmpty()
	}

	class Stack {
		Vector vector
		isEmpty(){
			return vector.isEmpty()
		}
	}

```
**Motivation**

* Using delegation makes  clear that you are making only partial use of the delegated class.
* You control which aspects of the interface to take and which to ignore.

Mechanics
## 67. Replace Delegation with Inheritance
You're using delegation and are often writing many simple delegations for the entire interface.   
_Make the delegating class a subclass of the delegate_
```java

	class Person {
		getName()
	}

	class Employee {
		Person person
		getName(){
			return person.getName()
		}
	}
```
to
```java

	class Person{
		getName()
	}
	class Employee extends Person{}

```
**Motivation**	 

* If you are using all the methods of the delegate.
* If you aren't using all the methods of the class to which you are delegating, you shouldn't use it.
* Beware of is that in which the delegate is shared by more than one object and is mutable. Data sharing is a responsibility that cannot be transferred back to inheritance.

# 12. BIG REFACTORINGS
## 68. Tease Apart Inheritance
You have an inheritance hierarchy that is doing two jobs at once.   
_Create two hierarchies and use delegation to invoke one from the other_
```java

	class Deal{}
	class ActiveDeal extends Deal{}
	class PassiveDeal extends Deal{}
	class TabularActiveDeal extends ActiveDeal{}
	class TabularPassiveDeal extends PassiveDeal{}
```
to
```java

	class Deal{
		PresentationStyle presettationStyle;
	}
	class ActiveDeal extends Deal{}
	class PassiveDeal extends Deal{}

	class PresentationStyle{}
	class TabularPresentationStyle extends PresentationStyle{}
	class SinglePresentationStyle extends PresentationStyle{}

```
**Motivation**

* Tangled inheritance leads to code duplication.
* If every class at a certain level in the hierarchy has subclasses that begin with the same adjective, you probably are doing two jobs with one hierarchy.

**Mechanics Note**   
Identify the different jobs being done by the hierarchy. Create a two-dimensional(or x-dimensional) grid and label the axes with the different jobs.

| Deal         | Active Deal | Passive Deal |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Tabular Deal |             |              |

## 69. Convert Procedural Design to Objects
You have code written in a procedural style.   
_Turn the data records into objects, break up the behavior, and move the behavior to the objects_
```java

	class OrderCalculator{
		determinePrice(Order)
		determineTaxes(Order)
	}
	class Order{}
	class OrderLine{}
```
to
```java

	class Order{
		getPrice()
		getTaxes()
	}
	class OrderLine{
		getPrice()
		getTaxes()
	}
```
**Motivation**
Use OOP (at least in JAVA)

## 70. Separate Domain from Presentation
You have GUI classes that contain domain logic.   
_Separate the domain logic into separate domain classes_
```java

	class OrderWindow{}
```
to
```java

	class OrderWindow{
		Order order;
}
```
**Motivation**

* Separates two complicated parts of the program into pieces that are easier to modify.
* Allows multiple presentations of the same business logic.
* Its worth is proved

## 71. Extract Hierarchy
You have a class that is doing too much work, at least in part through many conditional statements.   
_Create a hierarchy of classes in which each subclass represents a special case_
```java

	class BillingScheme{}
```
to
```java

	class BillingScheme{}
	class BusinessBillingScheme extends BillingScheme{}
	class ResidentialBillingScheme extends BillingScheme{}
	class DisabilityBillingScheme extends BillingScheme{}
```
**Motivation**   

* A class as implementing one idea become implementing two or three or ten.
