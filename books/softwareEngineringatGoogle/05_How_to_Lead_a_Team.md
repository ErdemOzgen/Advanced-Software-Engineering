### 5. How to Lead a Team

* Types of leadership roles
    * *Manager*: Leader of people
    * *Tech Lead* (*TL*): Leading technology efforts
    * *Tech Lead Manager* (*TLM*) is a combination of both
* *Influence without authority*: You can influence people even if they do not report to you
* Becoming a manager
    * Can initially be frustrating because your output is much less tangible than when writing code
    * You often forget about all the things you disliked when you were an IC
    * *servant leader* might be a better word for a manager: It’s your job to remove bureaucratic obstacles or to help achieve team consensus
    * > “Above all, resist the urge to manage"
    * > Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).
* Google avoids the Peter Principle by requiring people to perform at the next level before promoting them
* > If an individual succeeds, praise them in front of the team. If an individual fails, give constructive criticism in private
* As a TL it is difficult to watch someone new struggle with something for a few hours that you could solve yourself very quickly. However, you need to give people a chance to learn
* *Compliment sandwich*: Negative feedback wrapped between two compliments to soften the blow. This should be avoided because it is too easy to miss the actual feedback
* “What else do you need?” is a great way to wrap up meetings
* Getting your hands dirty and doing some IC work is an easy way to gain your team’s respect and to understand better what they are doing
* Keep in mind that people are different and need different things
* Intrinsic motivation can be increased by autonomy, mastery, purpose ([ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_the_puzzle_of_motivation))
