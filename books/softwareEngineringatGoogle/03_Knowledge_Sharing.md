### 3. Knowledge Sharing

* There is a trade-off between short-term efficiency (“It’s faster for me to do it”) and long-term efficiency (teach others how to do it)
* *Parroting* / *mimicry*: Mindlessly copying code without really understanding the purpose
* Documentation scales better than personal advice. Both are necessary and sometimes also something in-between (i.e. someone recommends a certain piece of documentation)
* Psychological safety is important. People need to be comfortable in saying they do not understand things, otherwise it is hard for them to learn and get help
* Avoid (similar to the [recurse rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules))
    * Feigned surprise (“I can’t believe you didn’t know that)
    * “Well, actually"
    * Expressions of bias
    * Interrupting a conversation to give an opinion and then leaving it again. Commit to conversations if you think it's important enough to interrupt
* Context
    * Can really help to make you understand something, e.g. in style guides
    * *[Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence)*: Before removing or changing something, understand why it’s there (imagine a fence)
* > People react to incentives over platitudes
* *Readability*: Special approval in code reviews for writing readable code in a given language
    * This is a way to improve code reviews but also a way to share knowledge
    * Furthermore, it ensures that all of Google’s code is held to the same standard and style, which avoids tech islands appearing inside of Google
    * It’s quite costly as such a program does not scale well. Google considers it to be worth the cost though and internal research showed that it has a big impact on code quality
