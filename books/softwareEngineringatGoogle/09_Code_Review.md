### 9. Code Review

- Code is a liability: It needs to be maintained and is one more thing that can break. Thus, one should actually be careful with adding new code
- Requiring several approval bits means reviewers can focus on different things (i.e. general review, language readability, making sure the code fits into the project)
- Code reviews are tests for whether code is understandable. Since the reviewer typically does not know the code changes prior to the review, they are much more unbiased than the author
- > Additionally, code might be written only once, but it will be read dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times.
- Changelist description should discuss the *what* and the *why*
- Changelists should do just one thing, e.g. just fix a specific bug. This makes it easier to review them, to understand changes looking back, and to rollback faulty changes
- Most changes at Google are generated by machines. But these are still reviewed
