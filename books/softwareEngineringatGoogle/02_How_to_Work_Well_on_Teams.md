## Part 2: Culture

### 2. How to Work Well on Teams

* Hiding work until it is done can actually be harmful because you do not get any early feedback on it. You might accidentally reinvent the wheel or have fundamental flaws in your design
* *Bus factor*: Number of people that need to get hit by a bus to make the project fail
* As an analogy: You do not write 10.000 lines of code before asking the compiler to compile it for the first time. A tight feedback loop really helps when developing. You not only want such a feedback loop with the compiler but also with other people
* Many engineers have a sign for being in “do-not-disturb mode”, e.g. wearing headphones or putting a stuffed animal on their monitor
* Three pillars of social interaction
    1. Humility: You are not perfect. Be open to self-improvement
    2. Respect: Care about the people you work with and treat them kindly
    3. Trust: Believe in others
* Distinguish between a person and their work. Phrase feedback / code reviews accordingly
* If you’re not failing occasionally, you are not taking enough risks
* Failures need to be analyzed and documented, e.g. in *postmortem* documents. These should not be apologies but be about what you learned
* When you are too stubborn and reject anyone else’s ideas, people will stop suggesting stuff to you
* Googliness: People that
    * Thrive in ambiguity
    * Value feedback
    * Challenge status quo
    * Put the user first
    * Care about the team
    * Do the right thing
